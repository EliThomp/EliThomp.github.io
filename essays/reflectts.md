<h2>First Look at TypeScript</h2>

Typescript for a complete newbie has been familiar and different compared to the other languages I’ve worked with, such as Java, Python, and C. At a fundamental level, TypeScript builds on JavaScript by adding static typing, which is a unique feature compared to JavaScript's nature. My initial thoughts on TypeScript are that it has a balance between the strict structure of languages like C while also having the flexibility of JavaScript. This makes it easier to error check and form predictable patterns that can help with debugging and avoiding certain problems presented in JavaScript.

The primary difference between TypeScript and Python would be the way types are handled. Because Python is dynamically typed while TypeScript is more type safety it causes slightly slower programming while also leading the code to be more maintainable down the line. 

From a software engineering perspective, TypeScript seems to be a strong language that is suited well for large-scale applications. It seems to allow for more control when programming when compared to JavaScript which makes it easier to manage codebases over time. However, the problem is that it also makes the coding experience slower due to the added static typing.

<h2>Breaking a Sweat</h2>

When it comes to the Practice WODs, I’ve found them to be both entertaining and
extremely helpful. The timed exercises give me the ability to push myself while also being able to learn how to perform well under pressure. They also give me a visible benchmark that allows me to try to make myself get better with each attempt. This would be compared to just random homework assignments where I would be trying to finish the assignment. With these practice WODs, I am also trying to improve and become a more efficient programmer. This method is effective because it is very similar to real-life coding interviews and challenges that test a person’s efficiency and accuracy. 

That being said, this style of learning can also be stressful. The constant pressure to be on top of the course material and make sure you can perform well on the WODs sometimes distracts from the joy of pure learning. Due to this, I wish I could engage with the material without having the stress of being evaluated allowing me to fully learn the material. However, that is not a practical nor effective way since that would be further removed from real-life experiences as a software developer.

In conclusion, my initial experience with TypeScript has been positive, and I can see its value in large-scale applications. In addition to that, WODs are a great way to both learn and challenge myself to become better under pressure. I believe that as long as I stay on top of the course material and try my best to learn I will be able to become a better software engineer.
