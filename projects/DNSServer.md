In this project, I worked in a team of 4 to design and improve a Network LAN Simulator. The main function of the simulator was to upload and download files between a client and a server. The first step taken was to implement the ability to transfer files in packets of specific sizes while also leaving room to increase packet size for further improvements. Then we worked together in order to make a small user interface inside of terminal for the user to be able to download these files with a specific name and to be able to display and quit out of the client when they were finished.
