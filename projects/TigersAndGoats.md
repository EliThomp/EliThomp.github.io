In this project, machine learning techniques were applied to gaming strategies to improve the AI's performance in the traditional game Tigers and Goats. The primary goal was to develop the AI to become more efficient against real-life opponents. This was done by training the AI on various gameplay scenarios to improve its overall gameplay. 10+ students and teachers collaborated to improve the AI's abilities. My contribution was limited due to the structure of the group, however hopefully in the upcoming years, I will be able to contribute more.
